Practicing Git and Github


# GIT : version control system is a tools that helps to track changes in code

1. track the history of the code 
2. to collaborate with other developers

# GITHUB : website that allows developers to store and mange their code using GIT

- untracked : new files that git doesn't yet track
- modified : files that has changes
- staged : file is ready to be committed
- unmodified : unchanged 


2. uploads in the form of folders(Repository/ repo)

- `git config --global user.name "user name"`
- `git config --global user.email "xyz@gmail.com"`
- `git config --list`
- `git clone`
- `git status` : shows us the status of the repo
- `ls -a` inside the repo gives hidden files
- `git add <-file name->` adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area
- `git commit -m "some message"` it is the record the message about the changes we have done
- `git push origin main` upload local repo content to remote repo
- `git init` used to create a new git repo
- `git branch` to check in which branch we are in
- `git checkout <-branch name->` to navigate between branches
- `git checkout -b <-new branch name->` to create new branch
- `git branch -d <-branch name->` to delete branch
- `git diff <-branch name->` to compare commits , branches, files and more
- `git merge <-branch name->` to merge 2 branches
